# My-bio

I am currently working as a Senior Analyst at Sport England. My role involves handling official statistics, analysing quantitative data, generating insights and presenting the latest findings to key stakeholders, both internal and external. My primary focus is coordinating and project managing the Active Lives releases (for both the Active Lives Adults and Children and Young People surveys). Prior to working at Sport England, I worked at Critical Research (Critical), a market research agency for nearly 6 years. At Critical, I was progressed from Research Executive to Senior Research Executive and then to Research Manager. I led multiple sports accounts, including England Athletics, the Lawn Tennis Association and The FA. My skills include SPSS, Microsoft Office & PowerBI, SQL, attention to detail, line management, project management, report writing, team building, & being driven and highly passionate about what I do. I have a keen interest in sports, being an active member of London Heathside Athletics Club.
